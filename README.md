# Gratitude++

A full-stack web application built as my senior capstone project.
Gratitude++ is a secure, cloud-based personal journaling app that allows
users to reflect on their day and store entries in real time.

The application features authentication, user-specific data isolation,
and a responsive React frontend backed by Firebase services.

## Key Features
- User authentication with Google OAuth
- User-isolated data storage using Firebase Realtime Database
- Realtime updates without page refresh
- Responsive React UI

## Tech Stack
- React
- Node.js
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Realtime Database

## My Contributions
- Designed and implemented the frontend React component structure
- Integrated Firebase authentication and database access
- Implemented security rules to isolate user data
- Collaborated as part of a capstone team using GitHub

## Running the Project

This project requires Firebase configuration (Authentication and Realtime Database)
and is not intended to be run without setting up a Firebase project.

Source code is provided to demonstrate application architecture,
authentication flow, and data isolation logic.
